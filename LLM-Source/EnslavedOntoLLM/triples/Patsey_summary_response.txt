Description Module:  
1. hasDescription(Agent, Description): hasDescription(Patsy, "Often used as a diminutive of the feminine name Patricia or the masculine name Patrick, and occasionally other names containing the syllable 'Pat'. It was also a nickname for Martha or Matilda in older usage. Notable people named Patsy include Australian children's entertainer Patsy Biscoe, British motor racing driver Patricia Patsy Burt, and American country singer Patsy Cline. The name has also been used for various fictional characters, such as Patsy in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and Patsy Stone in the British television series Absolutely Fabulous. The popularity of the name has decreased due to its North American meaning as 'dupe' or 'scapegoat'.")
