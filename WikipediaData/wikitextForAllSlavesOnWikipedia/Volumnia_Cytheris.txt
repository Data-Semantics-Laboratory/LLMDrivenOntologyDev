Volumnia Cytheris (fl. 1st-century BC) was an ancient Roman actress and mimae dancer. She is foremost known as the mistress of several famous Romans. 
Possibly born around 70 B.C., she was originally a slave of  Publius Volumnius Eutrapelius but later became a freedwoman. On stage, she was normally referred to only as Cytheris. The name derived from "Cythera" a nickname for Aphrodite. She had relationships with Brutus and Mark Antony, which attracted a lot of attention in contemporary ancient Rome.  She is mentioned as the companion of her aristocratic lovers in social occasions when the presence of a courtesan was otherwise not common, and considered shocking.  
At one point Cicero's wife asked Cytheris to help mend the relationship between her husband and Cytheris lover Mark Antony. 
Her rejection of Cornelius Gallus reportedly provided the theme for Virgil's tenth Eclogue. Gallus refers to her in his work under the name Lycoris, which alludes to one of the names "Lycoreus"  the god Apollo, Greek god of music.  
She is one of few free influential Roman courtesans mentioned by her contemporaries, others being Praecia and Chelidon. Cytheris' fate is unknown and she is not mentioned in any sources after a certain point.
