Scott Winfield Bond, also known as the "Black Rockefeller" (March 15, 1852 â€“ March 24, 1933), was an African-American businessman in Arkansas known for his work in agricultural real estate, merchandising, and factory production in St. Francis County. Born into slavery, he eventually became the state's first Black millionaire, worth over $2M by the age of 60.
He was a member of Booker T. Washington's National Negro Business League, and his relationship with the Black Catholic journalist Daniel Rudd was also notable, as Rudd came to Arkansas to work for him later in life.
Bond died at the age of 81 in a farm accident, wherein he was gored to death by an ox.
