William Henry Heard (born 1935 in Michigan) is a malacologist, and an authority on freshwater mollusks, especially freshwater pelecypods (clams). He is an emeritus professor in the Department of Biological Sciences, at Florida State University.
Heard was the winner of the  "Lifetime Achievement Award" for 2001 from the Freshwater Mollusk Conservation Society. He has had two species of mayflies named in his honor: Symbiocloeon heardi MÃ¼ller-Liebenau and Povilla heardi Hubbard. Heard discovered these insects in Thailand, where they were living within the shells of freshwater clams.
