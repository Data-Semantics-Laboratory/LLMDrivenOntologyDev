Molly Williams (fl. 1818) was the first known female, and first known black, firefighter in the United States.
An African American, she was a slave of the New York City merchant Benjamin Aymar. She was affiliated with the Oceanus Engine Company #11 in lower Manhattan. During her time in the company, she was called Volunteer No. 11. Williams made a distinguished presence in her sturdy work clothes of calico dress and checked apron  Her service was noted particularly during the blizzard of 1818. Male firefighters were scarce due to a cholera outbreak, but Williams took her place with the men on the dragropes and pulled the pumper to the fire through the deep snow.
When asked, Williams always replied: "‘I belongs to ole ‘Leven; I allers runs wid dat ole bull-gine.’"
