Titus Kent was an enslaved man in colonial Suffield, Connecticut, the father of Titus Gay and a Connecticut militiaman in the American Revolutionary War. Kent served with his enslaver, Elihu Kent (1733â€“1814), and with others from Suffield, Connecticut. 
Kent served in the 3rd Connecticut Regiment in the Connecticut Line; Colonel Samuel Wyllys commanded, serving under General Samuel Holden Parsons. His regiment served in the New York area throughout its service.
Suffield volunteers comprised about one-third of the Connecticut militia. There was no official town militia; every town contributed to the Connecticut militia while possibly dividing up into different platoons, regiments, etc., based on location. Initially, the Continental Congress discouraged enslaved men from enlisting in the Continental Army, to appease the slave states. However, the Kingdom of Great Britain offered freedom to enslaved people who fought on behalf of the British Army, forcing the Congress to relent and offer the same. Other enslaved people became part of the war everywhere.
