Bissula (flourished in 4th century AD) was an Alemannic woman in the 4th century. She was captured by the Romans in 368 at the Battle of Solicinium, in the area of Württemberg, at a young age and became a slave of the Roman poet Ausonius who had participated in the campaign. Ausonius, who by then was a widower of about 60 years of age, fell in love with Bissula and released her from slavery. He wrote a poem on her, de Bissula ("About Bissula"), which he sent to his friend Paulus.
