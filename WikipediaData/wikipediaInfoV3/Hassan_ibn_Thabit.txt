Ḥassān ibn Thābit (Arabic: حسان بن ثابت)  (born c. 563, Medina died 674) was an Arabian poet and one of the Sahaba, or companions of Muhammad, who was best known for poems in defense of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

He was born in Medina, and was a member of the Banu Khazraj tribe. Muhammad gave him a slave, Sirin, as a concubine.
His writings in defence of Muhammad refer to contemporary events that have been useful in documenting the period. He was also Islam's first religious poet, using many phrases from the Qur'an in his verses.
