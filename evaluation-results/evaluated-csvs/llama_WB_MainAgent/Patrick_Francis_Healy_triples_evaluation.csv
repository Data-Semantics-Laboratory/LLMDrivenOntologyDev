has_interagent_relationship_type_to(agent, relationship_type): has_interagent_relationship_type_to(joseph vance lewis, 'enslaver') 2. is_relationship_to(agent, agent): is_relationship_to(joseph vance lewis, 'bwril nate'). note: the interagent relationship record module describes the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner. so use the keywords enslaver or owner to describe the relationship type. sex record module: 1. has_sex(agent, sex_type): has_sex(joseph vance lewis, 'male'). occupation record module: 1. has_occupation(agent, occupation): has_occupation(joseph vance lewis, 'slave, educator, lawyer, and autobiographer'). age record module: 1. has_age(agent, age): has_age(joseph vance lewis, 72) 2. has_birthdate(agent, date_of_birth): has_birthdate(joseph vance lewis, 'december 25, 1853') 3. has_deathdate(agent, date_of_death): has_deathdate(joseph vance lewis, 'april 24, 1925'). person status record module: 1. has_person_status (agent, person_status): has_person_status(joseph vance lewis, 'enslaved person, lawyer') 2. has_status_generating_event(person_status, event): has_status_generating_event(enslaved person, 'sale of estate of joseph

listed in the text file.the birth and death dates are mentioned in parenthesis after the agent name. for example: joseph vance lewis (december 25, 1853 – april 24, 1925), was a slave who was freed. here the birth date is december 25, 1853 and death date is april 24, 1925.  so the ontology module relations for the agent joseph vance lewis are populated based on the text.  for example, the name record module has three relations: has_name(agent, name), has_surname(agent, surname), and has_first_name(agent, first_name). the relations for the other modules are populated similarly.  the relations in the interagent relationship record module describe the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner.  the sex record module has one relation: has_sex(agent, sex_type).  the occupation record module has one relation: has_occupation(agent, occupation).  the age record module has three relations: has_age(agent, age), has_birthdate(agent, date_of_birth), and has_deathdate(agent, date_of_death).  the person status record module has three relations: has_person_status (agent, person_status), has_status_generating_event(person_status, event), and recorded_at(person_status_information, event).  the race record module has one relation: has_race_or_color(agent, race_or_color).  the ontology module relations for the agent joseph vance lewis are populated based on the text.  the relations in the ontology modules are used to describe the properties and relationships of the agent, and can be used to answer a wide range of questions about the agent.  the ontology module relations can be used to populate the ontology based on the text in the form of the module relations like:  name record module:1. has_name(agent, name): has_name(joseph vance lewis, 'joseph vance lewis') 2. has_surname(agent, surname): has_surname(joseph vance lewis, 'lewis') 3. has_first_name(agent, first_name): has_first_name(joseph vance lewis,

hasparticipantrole,child,ontology module that is related to the agent,"is: name record module, interagent relationship record module, sex record module, occupation record module, age record module, person status record module, and race record module. based on the text, the ontology module relations are populated as follows: 1. name record module: 1. has_name(agent, name): has_name(joseph vance lewis, 'joseph vance lewis') 2. has_surname(agent, surname): has_surname(joseph vance lewis, 'lewis') 3. has_first_name(agent, first_name): has_first_name(joseph vance lewis, 'joseph').interagent relationship record module: 1. has_interagent_relationship_type_to(agent, relationship_type): has_interagent_relationship_type_to(joseph vance lewis, 'enslaver') 2. is_relationship_to(agent, agent): is_relationship_to(joseph vance lewis, 'bwril nate'). note: the interagent relationship record module describes the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner. so use the keywords enslaver or owner to describe the relationship type. sex record module: 1. has_sex(agent, sex_type): has_sex(joseph vance lewis, 'male'). occupation record module: 1. has_occupation(agent, occupation): has_occupation(joseph vance lewis, 'slave, educator, lawyer, and autobiographer'). age record module: 1. has_age(agent, age): has_age(joseph vance lewis, 72) 2. has_birthdate(agent, date_of_birth): has_birthdate(joseph vance lewis, 'december 25, 1853') 3. has_deathdate(agent, date_of_death): has_deathdate(joseph vance lewis, 'april 24, 1925'). person status record module: 1.

for which there is no information listed in the text file.the birth and death dates are mentioned in parenthesis after the agent name. for example: joseph vance lewis (december 25, 1853 – april 24, 1925), was a slave who was freed. here the birth date is december 25, 1853 and death date is april 24, 1925.  so the ontology module relations for the agent joseph vance lewis are populated based on the text.  for example, the name record module has three relations: has_name(agent, name), has_surname(agent, surname), and has_first_name(agent, first_name). the relations for the other modules are populated similarly.  the relations in the interagent relationship record module describe the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner.  the sex record module has one relation: has_sex(agent, sex_type).  the occupation record module has one relation: has_occupation(agent, occupation).  the age record module has three relations: has_age(agent, age), has_birthdate(agent, date_of_birth), and has_deathdate(agent, date_of_death).  the person status record module has three relations: has_person_status (agent, person_status), has_status_generating_event(person_status, event), and recorded_at(person_status_information, event).  the race record module has one relation: has_race_or_color(agent, race_or_color).  the ontology module relations for the agent joseph vance lewis are populated based on the text.  the relations in the ontology modules are used to describe the properties and relationships of the agent joseph vance lewis.  the ontology module relations can be used to answer questions about the agent, such as ""what is the name of the agent?"" or ""what is the occupation of the agent?"" or ""what is the race of the agent?""  the ontology module relations can also be used to answer more complex questions, such as ""what is the relationship between the agent and another agent?"" or ""what is the status of the agent?""  the ontology module relations provide a way to describe the properties and relationships of the agent, and can be used to answer a wide range of questions about the agent.  the ontology module relations can be used to populate the ontology based on the text in the form of the module relations like:  name record module:1. has_name(agent, name): has_name(joseph vance lewis, 'joseph vance lewis') 2. has_surname(agent, surname): has_surname(joseph vance lewis, 'lewis') 3. has_first_name(agent, first_name): has_first_name(joseph vance lewis, 'joseph').interagent relationship record module: 1.

lewis, 'bwril nate'). note: the interagent relationship record module describes the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner. so use the keywords enslaver or owner to describe the relationship type. sex record module: 1. has_sex(agent, sex_type): has_sex(joseph vance lewis, 'male'). occupation record module: 1. has_occupation(agent, occupation): has_occupation(joseph vance lewis, 'slave, educator, lawyer, and autobiographer'). age record module: 1. has_age(agent, age): has_age(joseph vance lewis, 72) 2. has_birthdate(agent, date_of_birth): has_birthdate(joseph vance lewis, 'december 25, 1853') 3. has_deathdate(agent, date_of_death): has_deathdate(joseph vance lewis, 'april 24, 1925'). person status record module: 1. has_person_status (agent, person_status): has_person_status(joseph vance lewis, 'enslaved person, lawyer') 2. has_status_generating_event(person_status, event): has_status_generating_event(enslaved person, 'sale of estate of joseph

'emancipation'). race record module: has_race_or_color(agent, race_or_color): has_race_or_color(joseph vance lewis, african-american).  note: skip the relations for which there is no information listed in the text file.the birth and death dates are mentioned in parenthesis after the agent name. for example: joseph vance lewis (december 25, 1853 – april 24, 1925), was a slave who was freed. here the birth date is december 25, 1853 and death date is april 24, 1925.  so the ontology module relations for the agent joseph vance lewis are populated based on the text.  for example, the name record module has three relations: has_name(agent, name), has_surname(agent, surname), and has_first_name(agent, first_name). the relations for the other modules are populated similarly.  the relations in the interagent relationship record module describe the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner.  the sex record module has one relation: has_sex(agent, sex_type).  the occupation record module has one relation: has_occupation(agent, occupation).  the age record module has three relations: has_age(agent, age), has_birthdate(agent, date_of_birth), and

hasname,patrick francis healy,ontology module that is related to the agent,"is: name record module, interagent relationship record module, sex record module, occupation record module, age record module, person status record module, and race record module. based on the text, the ontology module relations are populated as follows: 1. name record module: 1. has_name(agent, name): has_name(joseph vance lewis, 'joseph vance lewis') 2. has_surname(agent, surname): has_surname(joseph vance lewis, 'lewis') 3. has_first_name(agent, first_name): has_first_name(joseph vance lewis,

is_relationship_to(agent, agent): is_relationship_to(joseph vance lewis, 'bwril nate'). note: the interagent relationship record module describes the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner. so use the keywords enslaver or owner to describe the relationship type. sex record module: 1. has_sex(agent, sex_type): has_sex(joseph vance lewis, 'male'). occupation record module: 1. has_occupation(agent, occupation): has_occupation(joseph vance lewis, 'slave, educator, lawyer, and autobiographer'). age record module: 1. has_age(agent, age): has_age(joseph vance lewis, 72) 2.

lewis, african-american).  note: skip the relations for which there is no information listed in the text file.the birth and death dates are mentioned in parenthesis after the agent name. for example: joseph vance lewis (december 25, 1853 – april 24, 1925), was a slave who was freed. here the birth date is december 25, 1853 and death date is april 24, 1925.  so the ontology module relations for the agent joseph vance lewis are populated based on the text.  for example, the name record module has three relations: has_name(agent, name), has_surname(agent, surname), and has_first_name(agent, first_name). the relations for the other modules are populated similarly.  the relations in the interagent relationship record module describe the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner.  the sex record module has one relation: has_sex(agent, sex_type).  the occupation record module has one relation: has_occupation(agent, occupation).  the age record module has three relations: has_age(agent, age), has_birthdate(agent, date_of_birth), and has_deathdate(agent, date_of_death).  the person status record module has three relations: has_person_status (agent, person_status), has_status_generating_event(person_status, event), and recorded_at(person_status_information, event).  the race record module has one relation: has_race_or_color(agent, race_or_color).  the ontology module relations for the agent joseph vance lewis are populated based on the text.  the relations in the ontology modules are used to describe the properties and relationships of the agent joseph vance lewis.  the ontology module relations can be used to answer questions about the agent, such as ""what is the name of the agent?"" or ""what is the occupation of the agent?"" or ""what is the race of the agent?""  the ontology module relations can also be used to answer more complex questions, such as ""what is the relationship between the agent and another agent?"" or ""what is the status of the agent?""  the ontology module relations provide a way to describe the properties and relationships of the agent, and can be used to answer a wide range of questions about the agent.  the ontology module relations can be used to populate the ontology based on the text in the form of the module relations like:  name record module:1. has_name(agent, name): has_name(joseph vance lewis, 'joseph vance lewis') 2. has_surname(agent, surname): has_surname(joseph vance lewis, 'lewis') 3. has_first_name(agent, first_name): has_first_name(joseph vance lewis, 'joseph').interagent

has_race_or_color(agent, race_or_color).  the ontology module relations for the agent joseph vance lewis are populated based on the text.  the relations in the ontology modules are used to describe the properties and relationships of the agent joseph vance lewis.  the ontology module relations can be used to answer questions about the agent, such as ""what is the name of the agent?"" or ""what is the occupation of the agent?"" or ""what is the race of the agent?""  the ontology module relations can also be used to answer more complex questions, such as ""what is the relationship between the agent and another agent?"" or ""what is the status of the agent?""  the ontology module relations provide a way to describe the properties and relationships of the agent, and can be used to answer a wide range of questions about the agent.  the ontology module relations can be used to populate the ontology based on the text in the form of the module relations like:  name record module:1. has_name(agent, name): has_name(joseph vance lewis, 'joseph vance lewis') 2. has_surname(agent, surname): has_surname(joseph vance lewis, 'lewis') 3. has_first_name(agent, first_name): has_first_name(joseph vance lewis, 'joseph').interagent relationship record module: 1. has_interagent_relationship_type_to(agent, relationship_type): has_interagent_relationship_type_to(joseph vance lewis, 'enslaver') 2. is_relationship_to(agent, agent): is_relationship_to(joseph vance lewis, 'bwril nate'). note: the interagent relationship record module describes the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner. so use the keywords enslaver or owner to describe the relationship type. sex record module: 1. has_sex(agent, sex_type): has_sex(joseph vance lewis, 'male'). occupation record module: 1. has_occupation(agent, occupation): has_occupation(joseph vance lewis, 'slave, educator, lawyer, and autobiographer'). age record module: 1. has_age(agent, age): has_age(joseph vance lewis, 72) 2. has_birthdate(agent, date_of_birth): has_birthdate(joseph vance lewis, 'december 25, 1853') 3. has_deathdate(agent, date_of_death): has_deathdate(joseph vance lewis, 'april 24, 1925'). person status record module: 1. has_person_status (agent, person_status): has_person_status(joseph vance lewis, 'enslaved person, lawyer') 2. has_status_generating_event(person_status, event): has_status_generating_event(enslaved person, 'sale of estate of joseph dubreuil'), has_status_generating_event(lawyer, 'emancipation') 3. recorded_at(person_status_information, event): recorded_at(enslaved person, 'sale of estate of joseph dubreuil'), recorded_at(lawyer, 'emancipation'). race record module: has_race_or_color(agent, race_or_color): has_race_or_color(joseph vance lewis, african-american).  note: skip the relations for which there is no information listed in the text file.the birth and death dates are mentioned in parenthesis after the agent name. for example: joseph vance lewis (december 25, 1853 – april 24, 1925), was a slave who was freed. here the birth date is december 25, 1853 and death date is april 24, 1925.  so the ontology module relations for the agent joseph vance lewis are populated based on the text.  for example, the name record module has three relations: has_name(agent, name), has_surname(agent, surname), and has_first_name(agent, first_name). the relations for the other modules are populated similarly.  the relations in the interagent relationship record module describe the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner.  the sex record module has one relation: has_sex(agent, sex_type).  the occupation record module has one relation: has_occupation(agent, occupation).  the age record module has three relations: has_age(agent, age), has_birthdate(agent, date_of_birth), and has_deathdate(agent, date_of_death).  the person status record module has three relations: has_person_status (agent, person_status), has_status_generating_event(person_status, event), and recorded_at(person_status_information, event).  the race record module has one relation: has_race_or_color(agent, race_or_color).  the ontology module relations for the agent joseph vance lewis are populated based on the text.  the relations in the ontology modules are used to describe
