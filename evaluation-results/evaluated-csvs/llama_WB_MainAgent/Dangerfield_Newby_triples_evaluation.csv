after the agent name. for example: dangerfield f. newby (c. 1820 – october 17, 1859), was a slave who was freed. here the birth date is c. 1820 and death date is october 17, 1859. the age range is mentioned as 30-40, but since there is no specific date of birth mentioned, we cannot determine the exact age. i hope this helps. let me know if you have any further questions. 1.
