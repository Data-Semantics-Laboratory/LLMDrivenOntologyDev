information listed in the text file. the birth and death dates are mentioned in parenthesis after the agent name. for example: madison washington (december 25, 1853 – april 24, 1925), was a slave who was freed. here the birth date is december 25, 1853 and death date is april 24, 1925. however, the provided text does not mention the birth and death dates for madison washington. so, we use 'unknown' for the birth and death dates. the enslaver is john r. hewell and the event that generated the enslaved status is the sale of the estate. the event that generated the freed status is the creole slave revolt. the text does not mention the occupation, ethnolinguistic descriptor, and person status information for madison washington. therefore, we skip these relations. the text also does not mention the interagent relationship type to another agent who is an enslaver or owner. therefore, we use the keyword 'enslaver' to describe the relationship type.  answer: the ontology module relations for madison washington are populated as follows: name record module: 1. has_name(agent, name): has_name(madison washington, 'madison washington') 2. has_surname(agent, surname): has_surname(madison

was freed. here the birth date is december 25, 1853 and death date is april 24, 1925. however, the provided text does not mention the birth and death dates for madison washington. so, we use 'unknown' for the birth and death dates. the enslaver is john r. hewell and the event that generated the enslaved status is the sale of the estate. the event that generated the freed status is the creole slave revolt. the text does not mention the occupation, ethnolinguistic descriptor, and person status information for madison washington. therefore, we skip these relations. the text also does not mention the interagent relationship type to another agent who is an enslaver or owner. therefore, we use the keyword 'enslaver' to describe the relationship type.  answer: the ontology module relations for
