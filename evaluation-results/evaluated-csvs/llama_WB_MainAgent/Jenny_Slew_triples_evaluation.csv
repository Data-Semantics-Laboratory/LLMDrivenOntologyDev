hassurname,slew,birth and death dates are mentioned in parenthesis after the agent,"name. for example: jenny slew (1719 – after 1765), was a slave who was freed. here the birth date is 1719 and death date is after 1765. the age of jenny slew is mentioned as 43. the relationship type is enslaver, and the enslaver is john whipple jr. the person status is enslaved person, and the status generating event is kidnapping. the person status is also free person, and the status generating event is court ruling. the race is african-american. the occupation is slave. the sex is female. the first name is jenny, and the surname is slew. i hope this helps!
