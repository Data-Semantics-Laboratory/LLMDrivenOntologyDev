publication of his memoir. the recorded at event is the event at which the status change occurred. for example, his enslavement occurred at the time of his enslavement, his emancipation occurred at the time of his publication of his memoir, and his status as an abolitionist and writer occurred at the time of his publication of his memoir. the race or color of the agent is african-american. the
