name record module: 1. has_name(agent, name): has_name(charles caldwell, 'charles caldwell') 2. has_surname(agent, surname): has_surname(charles caldwell, 'caldwell') 3. has_first_name(agent, first_name): has_first_name(charles caldwell, 'charles'). interagent relationship record module: 1. has_interagent_relationship_type_to(agent, relationship_type): has_interagent_relationship_type_to(charles caldwell, 'former slave') 2. is_relationship_to(agent, agent): is_relationship_to(charles caldwell, 'bwril nate'). note: the interagent relationship record module describes the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner. so use the keywords enslaver or owner to describe the relationship type. sex record module: 1. has_sex(agent, sex_type): has_sex(charles caldwell, 'male'). occupation record module: 1. has_occupation(agent, occupation): has_occupion read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_caldwell_(mississippi_politician)
