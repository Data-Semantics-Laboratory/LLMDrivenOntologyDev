module describes the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner. so use the keywords enslaver or owner to describe the relationship type. 3. has_interagent_relationship_type_to(agent,

note: the interagent relationship record module describes the relationship to another agent who is an enslaver or owner. so use the keywords enslaver or owner to describe the relationship type. 3.

parenthesis after the agent name. for example: horace king (1813 – 1885), was a slave who was freed. here the birth date is 1813 and death date is 1885.  occupation record module: 1.
