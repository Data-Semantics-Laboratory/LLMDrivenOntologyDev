"He commanded several vessels within the territory of the Alaskan coastline.Following U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward's Alaska purchase of the vast region in 1867, Healy patrolled the 20,000 miles (32,000 km) of Alaskan coastline for more than 20 years, earning great respect from the natives and seafarers alike. After commercial fishing had depleted the whale and seal populations, his assistance with the introduction of Siberian reindeer helped prevent starvation among the Alaskan Natives. The author Jack London was inspired by Healy's command of the renowned  USRC Bear. It had a thick wooden hull, and was powered by steam-and-sail for use as a proto-icebreaker; it was put into service as a cutter in 1884.Nicknamed ""Hell Roaring Mike"", Healy was the fifth of 10 children of the  Healy family of Georgia, known for their achievements in the North after being born into slavery. Their parents were an Irish-born planter and his African-American mixed-race slave, with whom he had a common-law marriage. His father arranged for the children to be formally educated at boarding schools in the North. Predominately European in ancestry, they identified as Irish Catholics."

"Healy was born into slavery near Macon, Georgia, in 1839, as the fifth of ten children of Michael Morris Healy, an Irish immigrant planter, and Mary Eliza Smith, his common-law wife, a mixed-race African-American slave.The senior Healy was born in 1795 in Roscommon, Ireland, and immigrated to the U.S. in 1818 as a young man. He eventually acquired 1,500 acres (6.1 km2) of land in Georgia near Macon. He eventually owned 49 slaves as workers for his plantation; among them was 16-year-old Mary Eliza Smith (or Clark), described as an octoroon or a mulatto, whom he took as his wife in 1829. Under the partus principle in slave law, the Healy children were legally slaves because their mother was enslaved. As such they were prohibited formal education in Georgia, and their father sent them north to be schooled, a common practice of wealthy white planters who had mixed-race children.Though not unusual, the Healys' common-law marriage violated laws against inter-racial marriage. Healy's wealth and ambition provided for his children's education. Most of the children, all but one surviving infancy, achieved noteworthy success as adults. In the North, the Healy siblings were educated as and identified as Irish Catholics. They were part of a growing ethnic group in the mid-19th century United States. During the late 20th century, their individual professional achievements were claimed as notable firsts for African Americans."	"refersToPlaceOfOrigin(Healy, Macon, Georgia)

"The oldest son, James Augustine Healy, born in 1830, first went to a Quaker school in New York and New Jersey. His father transferred him at age 14 to preparatory classes for the College of Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. His three younger brothers soon joined him: Hugh, 12, Patrick Francis Healy, 10, and Alexander Sherwood Healy (known as Sherwood), 8. Michael, then only 6, was not enrolled at Holy Cross until 1849.All four of the older brothers graduated from Holy Cross. The three eldest entered the priesthood. After attending seminaries in Montreal and Paris, James was ordained a priest at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in 1854. In the 20th century he was claimed as the first African-American priest in the Catholic Church. In 1875, he became the second bishop of the Diocese of Portland, Maine, and is known as the first U.S. Catholic African-American bishop.Patrick Healy became a Jesuit and was the first African American to earn a PhD; he completed it at Saint-Sulpice Seminary in Paris. At the age of 39, in 1874, he assumed the presidency of Georgetown College, at the time the largest Catholic college in the U.S.Sherwood Healy was also ordained as a priest, and earned a PhD at Saint-Sulpice. An expert in canon law, he served as director of the seminary in Troy, New York. Later he became rector of the cathedral in Boston. Sherwood was musical and formed the Boston Choral Union, which helped raise funds for a new cathedral. He died at age 39.The three Healy sisters attended parochial schools in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, ultimately entering Catholic orders. Martha, the oldest, left her convent after several years and moved to Boston, where two brothers were living and working. She married an Irish immigrant and had a son with him. Josephine lived with her family in Boston before joining the Religious Hospitallers of Saint Joseph. Eliza joined the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal, where she was known as Sister Mary Magdalen. After teaching in Quebec and Ontario, in 1903 Eliza was appointed abbess or mother superior of the convent and school of Villa Barlow in St. Albans, Vermont. She has become recognized as the first African American to reach this position.In May 1850, the Healys' mother Mary Eliza died, followed four months later by her husband, Michael Morris Healy. leaving James as the head of the family. He was unable to convince young Michael to follow him into the priesthood. Unhappy and rebellious at Holy Cross, Michael was sent in 1854 to a French seminary. In 1855, he left that school for England, where he signed on as a cabin boy with the Jumna, an American East Indian clipper, eventually serving as an officer on merchant vessels."

"In 1864 during the American Civil War, Healy returned to his family in Boston, where he applied for a commission in the Revenue Cutter Service. He was accepted as a third lieutenant on March 7, 1865, and his commission was signed by President Abraham Lincoln. He was promoted to second lieutenant on June 6, 1866. Under U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward, during the administration of President Andrew Johnson, the Alaska purchase was made on March 29, 1867.

"The Revenue Cutter Service became the principal government agency for transporting government officials, scientists, and doctors, as well as serving as the principal US law enforcement agency in the Alaska Territory. Healy was assigned to the newly commissioned USRC Reliance when it sailed around Cape Horn and arrived at Sitka, Alaska, on November 24, 1868. The following year he was transferred to USRC Lincoln in San Francisco, California. While serving on Lincoln, he was promoted to first lieutenant on July 21, 1870. On January 8, 1872, he received orders to report aboard USRC Active home-ported in New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he became familiar with the masters of whaling ships. His experience in this period played an important part of his later career in Alaska."	"[""The Revenue Cutter Service"", ""is-a"", ""Organization""]

"Healy returned to Alaskan waters aboard the newly built USRC Rush in 1875. In 1880, by request of the captain of Corwin, he was transferred to serve as executive officer, but the assignment did not last long. In August 1881 he assumed his first command on Rush. Renowned naturalist John Muir made one voyage with Healy as part of an ambitious government scientific program. Healy was serving as First Officer of USRC Thomas Corwin during the summer of 1881.By 1882 Healy was given command of Corwin and was already thoroughly familiar with the Bering Sea and Alaska. In this command, he enforced liquor laws, protected seal and whale populations under treaty; delivered supplies, mail and medicines to remote villages; returned deserters to merchant ships, collected weather data, rendered medical assistance, conducted search and rescue, enforced federal laws, and accomplished exploration work. In October 1882 he took part in the Angoon Bombardment, in which the village of Angoon, Alaska was destroyed following hostage taking by the Tlingit.He attained the rank of captain on March 3, 1883. At this point in his career, Healy had earned a reputation as a person thoroughly familiar with Alaskan waters and as a commander who expected the most from his vessel and crew. He was at the same time known to be a hard drinker, and most of his junior officers found him difficult. He was respected for his efforts to rescue vessels and crews in peril. Healy was often recognized for his humanitarian efforts, including being recognized by Congress for his life-saving work in the Arctic in 1885."	"Is-a(Match,EntityWithProvenance)

"He took command of Bear in 1887. His reputation with the whalers was so well established that when the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Seaman's Union requested a board of inquiry to consider charges of drunkenness and cruelty against him, the whaler skippers quickly got the drunkenness charges dismissed. The cruelty charges stemmed from an incident aboard the whaler Estrella in 1889: Healy had a seaman ""triced up"" to restore order. Healy defended his actions as an effort to quell a mutiny, and the charge was eventually dismissed.In July 1889, Healy paid a courtesy call to the skipper of USRC Rush, Captain Leonard G. Shepard, in an intoxicated state, a serious breach of naval etiquette. Shortly thereafter, Shepard became the Chief of the Revenue Cutter Bureau and he wrote Healy warning him that if he could not control his drinking, he could face loss of command. Healy replied stating that he ""pledge[d] to you by all I hold most sacred that while I live never to touch intoxicants of any kind or description....One thing I will hate and that is to give up my command of the Bear. I love the ship, tho [it is] hard work.""During the last two decades of the 19th century, Healy was essentially the federal government's law enforcement presence in the vast territory. In his twenty years of service between San Francisco and Point Barrow, he acted as judge, doctor, and policeman to Alaskan natives, merchant seamen and whaling crews. The Native Americans and Alaskan Natives throughout the vast regions of the north came to know and respect him and called his ship ""Healy's Fire Canoe."" During visits to Siberia, across the Bering Sea from the Alaskan coast, Healy observed that the Chukchi people had domesticated caribou (reindeer), and used them for food, travel, and clothing. He had noted the reduction in the seal and whale populations in Alaska from commercial fishing activities. To compensate for this and aid in transportation, working with Reverend Sheldon Jackson, a Presbyterian missionary and political leader in the territory, Healy helped introduce reindeer from Siberia to Alaska as a source of food, clothing and other necessities for the Native peoples. This work was noted in the New York Sun newspaper in 1894. Healy's compassion for the native population was expressed in many deeds and in his standing order: ""Never make a promise to a native you do not intend to keep to the letter."""

The birth year of Frederick and the marriage year of Healy are expressed using the temporal relations provided ('startsAt' and 'endsAt' respectively). The test text lacks more specific terms defined in your ontology (such as EventTypes or DocumentTypes), so no triples for these terms were extracted."	No triples were extracted from the given text.
"Over a century later, Healy's Coast Guard successors conduct missions reminiscent of his groundbreaking work: protecting the natural resources of the region, suppressing illegal trade, resupply of remote outposts, enforcement of the law, and search and rescue. Even in the early days of Arctic operations, science was an important part of the mission. Healy is now known as the first African-American to command a ship of the United States government. Commissioned in 1999, the research icebreaker USCGC Healy was named in his honor.To commemorate the entire family's achievements, the former site in Jones County, Georgia of the Healy plantation is called Healy Point. The area is the location of the Healy Point Country Club."	"Triples:

```

Here is an explanation for the extracted triples:

1. (EntityWithProvenance1, hasOriginalSourceType, DocumentTypes1)
   The text ""Report of the Cruise of the Revenue Marine Steamer Corwin in the Arctic Ocean, 1885"" can be understood as a document and hence an `EntityWithProvenance`. It has an original source type which is related to `DocumentTypes`.

2. (EntityWithProvenance1, availableFrom, ""Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office"")
   This extractable triple indicates the document is available from ""Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office.""

3. (EntityWithProvenance1, startsAt, ""1887"")
   In this context, the term ""startsAt"" could be associated with the publication year of the document, which is ""1887.""

Note: The ""EntityWithProvenance1,"" ""DocumentTypes1,"" and other numeric suffixes represent instances of those concepts from the ontology. Specific identifiers would be assigned when integrating this data into an actual semantic system."	"Extraction Results:

Assuming ""Influence Study"" is a research project:

"Healy was born into slavery near Macon, Georgia, in 1839, as the fifth of ten children of Michael Morris Healy, an Irish immigrant planter, and Mary Eliza Smith, his common-law wife, a mixed-race African-American slave.The senior Healy was born in 1795 in Roscommon, Ireland, and immigrated to the U.S. in 1818 as a young man. He eventually acquired 1,500 acres (6.1 km2) of land in Georgia near Macon. He eventually owned 49 slaves as workers for his plantation; among them was 16-year-old Mary Eliza Smith (or Clark), described as an octoroon or a mulatto, whom he took as his wife in 1829. Under the partus principle in slave law, the Healy children were legally slaves because their mother was enslaved. As such they were prohibited formal education in Georgia, and their father sent them north to be schooled, a common practice of wealthy white planters who had mixed-race children.Though not unusual, the Healys' common-law marriage violated laws against inter-racial marriage. Healy's wealth and ambition provided for his children's education. Most of the children, all but one surviving infancy, achieved noteworthy success as adults. In the North, the Healy siblings were educated as and identified as Irish Catholics. They were part of a growing ethnic group in the mid-19th century United States.

"The oldest son, James Augustine Healy, born in 1830, first went to a Quaker school in New York and New Jersey. His father transferred him at age 14 to preparatory classes for the College of Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. His three younger brothers soon joined him: Hugh, 12, Patrick Francis Healy, 10, and Alexander Sherwood Healy (known as Sherwood), 8. Michael, then only 6, was not enrolled at Holy Cross until 1849.All four of the older brothers graduated from Holy Cross. The three eldest entered the priesthood. After attending seminaries in Montreal and Paris, James was ordained a priest at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in 1854. In the 20th century he was claimed as the first African-American priest in the Catholic Church. In 1875, he became the second bishop of the Diocese of Portland, Maine, and is known as the first U.S. Catholic African-American bishop.Patrick Healy became a Jesuit and was the first African American to earn a PhD; he completed it at Saint-Sulpice Seminary in Paris. At the age of 39, in 1874, he assumed the presidency of Georgetown College, at the time the largest Catholic college in the U.S.Sherwood Healy was also ordained as a priest, and earned a PhD at Saint-Sulpice. An expert in canon law, he served as director of the seminary in Troy, New York. Later he became rector of the cathedral in Boston. Sherwood was musical and formed the Boston Choral Union, which helped raise funds for a new cathedral. He died at age 39.The three Healy sisters attended parochial schools in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, ultimately entering Catholic orders. Martha, the oldest, left her convent after several years and moved to Boston, where two brothers were living and working. She married an Irish immigrant and had a son with him. Josephine lived with her family in Boston before joining the Religious Hospitallers of Saint Joseph. Eliza joined the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal, where she was known as Sister Mary Magdalen. After teaching in Quebec and Ontario, in 1903 Eliza was appointed abbess or mother superior of the convent and school of Villa Barlow in St. Albans, Vermont. She has become recognized as the first African American to reach this position.In May 1850, the Healys' mother Mary Eliza died, followed four months later by her husband, Michael Morris Healy. leaving James as the head of the family. He was unable to convince young Michael to follow him into the priesthood. Unhappy and rebellious at Holy Cross, Michael was sent in 1854 to a French seminary. In 1855, he left that school for England, where he signed on as a cabin boy with the Jumna, an American East Indian clipper, eventually serving as an officer on merchant vessels."

Under U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward, during the administration of President Andrew Johnson, the Alaska purchase was made on March 29, 1867. The huge territory, with 20,000 miles (32,000 km) of coastline, was initially referred to by many skeptics as ""Seward's Folly"" or ""Seward's Ice Box."""

The following year he was transferred to USRC Lincoln in San Francisco, California. While serving on Lincoln, he was promoted to first lieutenant on July 21, 1870. On January 8, 1872, he received orders to report aboard USRC Active home-ported in New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he became familiar with the masters of whaling ships.

"Healy returned to Alaskan waters aboard the newly built USRC Rush in 1875. In 1880, by request of the captain of Corwin, he was transferred to serve as executive officer, but the assignment did not last long. In August 1881 he assumed his first command on Rush. Renowned naturalist John Muir made one voyage with Healy as part of an ambitious government scientific program. Healy was serving as First Officer of USRC Thomas Corwin during the summer of 1881.By 1882 Healy was given command of Corwin and was already thoroughly familiar with the Bering Sea and Alaska. In this command, he enforced liquor laws, protected seal and whale populations under treaty; delivered supplies, mail and medicines to remote villages; returned deserters to merchant ships, collected weather data, rendered medical assistance, conducted search and rescue, enforced federal laws, and accomplished exploration work. In October 1882 he took part in the Angoon Bombardment, in which the village of Angoon, Alaska was destroyed following hostage taking by the Tlingit.He attained the rank of captain on March 3, 1883. At this point in his career, Healy had earned a reputation as a person thoroughly familiar with Alaskan waters and as a commander who expected the most from his vessel and crew. He was at the same time known to be a hard drinker, and most of his junior officers found him difficult. He was respected for his efforts to rescue vessels and crews in peril. Healy was often recognized for his humanitarian efforts, including being recognized by Congress for his life-saving work in the Arctic in 1885."

"He took command of Bear in 1887. His reputation with the whalers was so well established that when the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Seaman's Union requested a board of inquiry to consider charges of drunkenness and cruelty against him, the whaler skippers quickly got the drunkenness charges dismissed. The cruelty charges stemmed from an incident aboard the whaler Estrella in 1889: Healy had a seaman ""triced up"" to restore order. Healy defended his actions as an effort to quell a mutiny, and the charge was eventually dismissed.In July 1889, Healy paid a courtesy call to the skipper of USRC Rush, Captain Leonard G. Shepard, in an intoxicated state, a serious breach of naval etiquette. Shortly thereafter, Shepard became the Chief of the Revenue Cutter Bureau and he wrote Healy warning him that if he could not control his drinking, he could face loss of command. Healy replied stating that he ""pledge[d] to you by all I hold most sacred that while I live never to touch intoxicants of any kind or description....One thing I will hate and that is to give up my command of the Bear. I love the ship, tho [it is] hard work.""During the last two decades of the 19th century, Healy was essentially the federal government's law enforcement presence in the vast territory. In his twenty years of service between San Francisco and Point Barrow, he acted as judge, doctor, and policeman to Alaskan natives, merchant seamen and whaling crews. The Native Americans and Alaskan Natives throughout the vast regions of the north came to know and respect him and called his ship ""Healy's Fire Canoe."" During visits to Siberia, across the Bering Sea from the Alaskan coast, Healy observed that the Chukchi people had domesticated caribou (reindeer), and used them for food, travel, and clothing. He had noted the reduction in the seal and whale populations in Alaska from commercial fishing activities. To compensate for this and aid in transportation, working with Reverend Sheldon Jackson, a Presbyterian missionary and political leader in the territory, Healy helped introduce reindeer from Siberia to Alaska as a source of food, clothing and other necessities for the Native peoples. This work was noted in the New York Sun newspaper in 1894. Healy's compassion for the native population was expressed in many deeds and in his standing order: ""Never make a promise to a native you do not intend to keep to the letter."""

The text appears to be a name, which could be related to the concept of `NameVariant` in the ontology, but without additional context, it is not possible to reliably extract triples from this isolated piece of information.

Moreover, the ontology concepts provided would generally require additional contextual information, like biographical data, spatial or temporal references, agent relationships, or provenance information, to generate meaningful triples. Since none of these are present in the test text, no triples can be extracted or produced according to the specific ontology relations given.

If ""Ajooni Svaibhang"" were a part of a larger text with more information, then it might be possible to extract relevant triples by applying the ontology concepts and relationships to that information. However, based on the given test text alone, there is no information to form a meaningful triple in the requested output format."	"Extraction Results:

It states that abilities such as flying through the air, walking through solid obstructions, diving into the ground, walking on water and so forth are achieved through changing one element, such as earth, into another element, such as air. The individual must master kasina meditation before this is possible. Dipa Ma, who trained via the Visuddhimagga, was said to demonstrate these abilities."	"[""born"",""Roberts"",""1753""]

"In the Samkhyakarika and Tattvasamasa, there are references to the attainment of eight siddhis by which ""one becomes free of the pain of ignorance, one gains knowledge, and experiences bliss""."	"{""text"": ""The power of the Samanids began to crumble in the latter half of the 10th century.""}

{""text"": ""With the weakened Samanids facing rising challenges from the Karakhanids for control of Transoxiana, Sebük later took control of all the provinces south of the Oxus and established the Ghaznavid Empire.""}"	"The ontology provided does not explicitly define specific relationships that would directly extract entities and their connections from historical texts. However, based on a general interpretation of the ontology and its potential application to the text, we can reasonably assume a few implicit relations based on the conceptual hierarchy provided. Given this and the lack of specific named entities in the ontology that match the text, I'll make inferences to extract plausible triples using the 'hasParticipantRoleType' and 'hasECVO' relations that could be interpreted from the event described in the text. Here they are:

1. (Alp Tigin, hasParticipantRoleType, commander)
2. (Sebük Tigin, hasParticipantRoleType, governor)
3. (Sebük Tigin, hasECVO, established)
4. (Ghaznavid Empire, hasECVO, established)

Please note, these triples are assumptions based on potential roles (""commander"" and ""governor"") that persons like Alp Tigin and Sebük Tigin could have and events (establishment of rule or an empire) that could be associated with the Ghaznavid Empire as discussed in historical context. The ontology does not provide specific guidance on identifying these relationships, so the triples are inferred based on common historical narrative structures."	"- Is-a(Alp_Tigin, Agent)

However, since the text does not provide explicit identifiers, dates, or typologies that are directly relatable to ontology concepts like ExternalReference, TemporalExtent, or EventTypes, I'm unable to generate any accurate triples directly from the text.

Generally, according to the ontology relations, we would extract triples when the text contains information directly relating to the defined relationships, such as defining an EntityWithProvenance (which a historian could be considered to be), identifying temporal information (specific dates), or mentioning provenance details (original source types). The text does give a broader description of Ismail Samani's characteristics and mode of governance, but it does not provide details that can be translated into the specified ontology triples.

If the text contained specific referential information such as dates for events, identifiers for documents, or descriptions of provenance activities and relationships, those could be used to construct triples with the given ontology relations. For example, if the text included a date like ""Ismail Samani ruled from 892 to 907"", we could construct a triple with startsAt and endsAt relations concerning his rule.

As text stands, there are no actionable triples that can be constructed without additional context or information, and thus, no test output is possible under the strict constraints provided."	"Extraction Results:

"Roberts was born on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in 1753. He was enslaved by Francis De Shields, a colonel in the Continental Army. Roberts fought beside De Shields in the American Revolutionary War, and once the seven-year war with Britain ended, worked for George Washington in Philadelphia. Roberts went with De Shields as his servant. When De Shields died, Roberts expected to be set free but instead was sold to William Ward. Roberts was torn away from his family and then sold at an auction in New Orleans to Calvin Smith."	"[

Editor: John L. Esposito
Document Type: Book Section (implied by the provided context)
Publisher: Oxford University Press
Publication Year: 1999
Author: Fred M. Donner

Based on the ontology relations provided, the test text contains an implicit `EntityWithProvenance` in the form of the document itself, with associated agents such as the author and the editor, and temporal and provenance details. The relations stemming from the ontology allow us to form the following triples:

1. Attribution Relation - The document is attributed to Fred M. Donner:
   - `attributedTo(EntityWithProvenance, Agent)`
   - `EntityWithProvenance: ""Muhammad and the Caliphate: Political history of the Islamic Empire up to the Mongol Conquest""`
   - `Agent: Fred M. Donner`

2. Original Source Type - The original source type for the document is a book section:
   - `hasOriginalSourceType(EntityWithProvenance, DocumentTypes)`
   - `EntityWithProvenance: ""Muhammad and the Caliphate: Political history of the Islamic Empire up to the Mongol Conquest""`
   - `DocumentTypes: Book Section`

3. Published By Relation - The document is published by Oxford University Press:
   - `performedBy(ProvenanceActivity, Agent)`
   - `ProvenanceActivity: Publishing`
   - `Agent: Oxford University Press`

4. Temporal Extent - The document references the year 1999:
   - `startsAt(TemporalExtent, xsd:date)`
   - `TemporalExtent: Publication Date`
   - `xsd:date: 1999`

From these, the triples in the specified output format are:

startsAt(Publication Date, ""1999"")
```

Please note that for some of the inferred relations, I have used placeholders like ""Publishing"" and ""Publication Date"" because the text does not provide explicit names for these entities; they are inferred based on the context and typical publication processes. Additionally, the ontology doesn't speak directly about publication years or publishing entities in the test text, so I have formulated the triples using the most appropriate available relations."

"Elias Polk (1806 – December 30, 1886) was a former enslaved African American, most known for being enslaved by President James K. Polk and his family from the time of his birth until emancipation in 1865. After the American Civil War, he became a conservative Democratic political activist, when most freedmen joined the Republican Party. As a person enslaved, Polk had lived and worked at the Polk farm in Maury County, Tennessee, in the Columbia, Tennessee home of James and Sarah Polk, in the White House in 1845, and the Polks' Nashville residence, ""Polk Place"" from 1849 to 1865. After the president died, Elias Polk continued to live at Polk Place in Nashville, where he continued to be enslaved by the widowed First Lady Sarah Childress Polk. Once Elias gained freedom, he embarked on a public speaking career which saw him take up the cause of the Democratic Party, and spoke on behalf of former Confederates and enslavers. This was done out of survival and economic stability. Elias is remembered today for his controversial stances and willingness to ""play the part"" of the faithful slave in order to subvert and mock the southern racial hierarchy to his advantage."

"In 1824, Samuel sent a, probably, 18-year-old Elias, to his son James K. Polk as a gift upon the latter's wedding to Sarah Childress. During his time with James and Sarah, Elias Polk worked as a ""body servant"", or valet, and ""coachman"" for James in Columbia, Tennessee.After James Polk was elected President in 1845, he arranged for Elias Polk and Henry Carter, Jr. (whom James Polk also enslaved) to work at the White House, in order to support the household. However, Elias's time in Washington, D.C. was cut short as he was sent to work for attorney James H. Thomas from 1846 to 1847. During the Polk Administration, Elias remained in Maury County laboring for Thomas until 1847, when Thomas was elected to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. At which time Elias's rental contract was transferred to a ""Mr. Matthews"" at the Nelson's House Hotel in Columbia, Tennessee. Elias would remain in this position until 1849, when the Polks returned to Tennessee following the end of the James's presidency. By April 1849, Elias was brought to Nashville to labor for James and Sarah Polk as an enslaved domestic servant at their mansion, Polk Place. He was taken back to Tennessee with James Polk's family.President Polk died on June 15, 1849, only three months after leaving office. From this time until the abolition of slavery in 1865, Elias Polk remained enslaved by the widowed, former first lady Sarah Childress Polk.Following the passage of the 13th Amendment and the end of slavery in the U.S. Elias began a public speaking career and became active in the Democratic Party, throwing ""in his political lot with displaced slave owners"". His political alliance was unusual at a time when most freedmen joined the Republican Party. In 1867, Polk was elected as the president of the ""Independent Colored Conservative National Club."" At a meeting whose speakers included Arthur St. Clair Colyar and Henry S. Foote in June 1867, Polk called for harmony between blacks and whites. He suggested that a new federal tax on cotton production hurt African Americans. However, it must be stated that this position appears to be more self serving than genuine. According to historian, Zacharie W. Kinslow, ""Elias Polk understood three things following the American Civil War. He was illiterate, he was around 60-years-old, and he was black. To say his options were limited is a real understatement! He was able to look as his situation and cultivate a following and a reputation that did not necessarily make him either popular or admirable. Instead, he chose economic stability and personal security over martyrdom and furthering the cause of Civil Rights for African Americans. He made a choice of survival within the southern racial caste system and there is something understandable and human in that. Even if it is a decision that makes us uncomfortable today."""

"After visiting Washington, D.C., in 1886, Elias Polk met with President Grover Cleveland at the White House and was informed by Captain Samuel Donelson, employee of the U.S. House of Representatives, that Elias was to be reappointed to his old position as a ""laborer"" at the Capitol. However, that same day, Elias Polk died on December 30, 1886, in hotel room in Washington, D.C. At the time of his death, Elias was in a considerable amount of debt and his wife, Mary, was forced to mortgage her Nashville home and carriage to pay off the debts. This left her without the funds to return Elias's body to Nashville for burial. Finally in February 1887, three months after his death, Elias's body was returned to Nashville, where a funeral was held at Clark's Chapel, later known as Clark Memorial United Methodist Church. He was buried in the Nashville City Cemetery.According to historian Zacharie Kinslow, ""During his life, Elias Polk went from being enslaved in the White House to one of the most controversial African-American political activists of his day."" For journalist Jesse J. Holland, the author of The Invisibles: The Untold Story of African-American Slaves in the White House, ""In today's parlance, we'd call (Polk) an 'Uncle Tom' because he's taking the gentry's side. But that's how he felt."""	"refersTo(NameRecord, ""de la Vaissière, Étienne"")

We can now generate potential triples based on the ontology relations. In the ontology, however, there are limited explicit relations provided for directly linking specific elements like authors' names or book titles to types. Nonetheless, I will infer the most plausible triples based on given ontology:

- (""Sogdian Traders: A History"", hasOriginalSourceType, DocumentTypes)

The above triples are formed by assuming that ""de la Vaissière, Étienne"" is an instance of a Person/Agent, ""Sogdian Traders: A History"" is a description/entity with provenance, and ""Brill"" is an instance of an Organization. The date ""2005"" is associated with the temporal extent of the book's publication.

Given the constraints of the ontology and the lack of specific textual details regarding many of the relations, this is a reasonable interpretation of potential triples. Please note that because the relation ""hasOriginalSourceType"" requires linking to DocumentTypes, and the test text lacks explicit specification of what kind of document type ""Sogdian Traders: A History"" is (e.g., book, article, journal), that specific triple is based on a common-sense assumption. Similarly, for the relation ""hasLicenseInformation"", the actual license information would need to be explicitly provided in the document or related metadata.

In 892, Ismail Samani (892–907) united the Samanid state under one ruler, thus effectively putting an end to the feudal system used by the Samanids. It was also under him that the Samanids became independent of Abbasid authority. However, by 945, the government was under the de facto control of the Turkic military slave faction, and the Samanid family's authority had become purely symbolic."	"Schindel, Nikolaus is-a Person

"The Samanid Empire is part of the Iranian Intermezzo, which saw the creation of a Persianate culture and identity that brought Iranian speech and traditions into the fold of the Islamic world. This later contributed to the formation of the Turko-Persian culture.The Samanids promoted the arts, giving rise to the advancement of science and literature, and thus attracted scholars such as Rudaki, Ferdowsi, and Avicenna. While under Samanid control, Bukhara was a rival to Baghdad in its glory. Scholars note that the Samanids revived Persian language and culture more than the Buyids and the Saffarids while continuing to use Arabic for sciences as well as religious studies. They considered themselves to be descendants of the Sasanian Empire.

"The Samanid dynasty was founded by Saman Khuda, his descendants became rulers of the Samanid Empire. He was a dehqan of Iranian origin from the village of Saman in Balkh province, in present-day northern Afghanistan. The earliest appearance of the Samanid family appears to be in Greater Khorasan rather than Transoxiana. In some sources, the Samanids claimed to be descended from the House of Mihran of Bahram Chobin. It has been claimed that the House of Saman belonged to the Oghuz Turks, although the veracity is unlikely. Originally a Zoroastrian, Saman Khuda converted to Islam during the governorship of Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri in Khorasan, and named his oldest son as Asad ibn Saman in the governor's honour. In 819, the governor of Greater Khorasan, Ghassan ibn Abbad, rewarded the four sons of Asad ibn Saman for their aid against the rebel Rafi ibn al-Layth. Nuh ibn Asad received Samarkand; Ahmad ibn Asad received Farghana; Yahya ibn Asad received Tashkent, and Ilyas ibn Asad received Herat."	"Andrey Voronikhin is-a Person

"In 839/40, Nuh seized Isfijab from the nomadic pagan Turks living in the steppe. Consequently, he had a wall constructed around the city to protect it from their attacks. He died in 841/2—his two brothers Yahya and Ahmad, were then appointed as the joint rulers of the city by the Tahirid governor of Khorasan. After Yahya died in 855, Ahmad took control over Châch, thus becoming the ruler of most of Transoxiana. He died in 864/5; his son Nasr I received Farghana and Samarkand, while his other son Ya'qub received Châch (areas around modern Tashkent/Chachkent). Meanwhile, the Tahirids' authority had significantly weakened after suffering several defeats to Saffarid ruler Ya'qub al-Saffar. Hence, causing the Tahirids to lose their grip over the Samanids, who became more or less independent. Nasr I, used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother Ismail to Bukhara, which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the Afrighid dynasty of Khwarazm. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.After not so long, disagreement over where to distribute tax money caused a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid caliphs continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892."

"Following Nasr's death, Ismail moved the capital of the Samanid dynasty from Samarkand to Bukhara. A few months later the Saffarid emir, Ya'qub al-Saffar, also died and was succeeded by his brother Amr ibn al-Layth, who saw himself as the heir of the Saffarids. In the spring of 900, Amr clashed with Ismail near Balkh, but was defeated and taken into captivity. Ismail thereafter sent him to Baghdad, where he was executed. Ismail was thereafter recognized as the ruler of all of Khorasan and Transoxiana by the caliph. Furthermore, he also received the investiture over Tabaristan, Ray and Isfahan. It was also during this period that the Afrighid dynasty was forced into submission.Before Ismail Samani's major victory against the Saffarids, he had made various expeditions in Transoxiana; in 892, he put an end to the Principality of Ushrusana by seizing all of its lands. During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, Ismail Samani invaded the territories of the Karluk Turks, taking Talas and converting the Nestorian church there into a mosque. The same year, he conducted a campaign to gather slaves, taking ten to fifteen thousand captives.In 900, Ismail sent an army under Muhammad ibn Harun al-Sarakhsi against Muhammad ibn Zayd, the Zaydi ruler of Tabaristan and Gorgan. The invasion was successful; Muhammad ibn Zayd was killed and Tabaristan was conquered by the Samanids. However, Muhammad ibn Harun shortly revolted, forcing Ismail himself to invade the region the following year. Muhammad ibn Harun thereafter fled to Daylam, while Ismail reconquered Tabaristan and Gorgan. In 901, Amr Saffari was defeated at the battle of Balkh by the Samanids, which reduced the Saffarid dynasty to a minor tributary in Sistan. It was during this period that the Samanids were at their height of power, ruling as far as Qazvin in the west and Peshawar in the east."

"Ismail is known in history as a competent general and a strong ruler; many stories about him are written in Arabic and Persian sources. Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand went unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the walls—earlier strong, but now falling apart—were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the Karakhanids and other enemies.Ismail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son Ahmad Samani (r. 907–914)."

"Not long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin Abu Salih Mansur was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an Alid named Hasan al-Utrush was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under Muhammad ibn Sa'luk to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara. During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to Arabic, which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son Nasr II (r. 914–943) succeeded him."

Example of the kind of information needed for a hypothetical triple:

"Due to Nasr's youth, his prime minister Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under his paternal grand-uncle, Ishaq ibn Ahmad, who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized Nishapur and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915. Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi, rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under Ahmad ibn Sahl to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in Merv to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general Hamuya ibn Ali managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at Marw al-Rudh; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920."

"In the west, Nasr II clashed several times with Daylamite and Gilite rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler Lili ibn al-Nu'man invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the Simjurid general Simjur al-Dawati. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, Makan ibn Kaki, seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed. Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the Ziyarid ruler Mardavij, who managed to conquer the region. In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor Vushmgir his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at Iskhabad."

"In 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of Isma'ili missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son Nuh I, however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of tuberculosis after a few months.Right when Nuh I ascended the throne, a revolt erupted in Khwarazm, which he managed to suppress. Later in 945, he had to deal with the Muhtajid ruler Abu 'Ali Chaghani, who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to Ibrahim ibn Simjur. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as Abu Mansur Muhammad, whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle Ibrahim ibn Ahmad as amir in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in Chaghaniyan. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers."	"refersToPlaceOfOrigin(OriginRecord, Place)

Fortunately for Abu Ali Chaghani, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of Khuttal, and the Kumiji mountain people, but in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah as hostage to Bukhara.By 945, the Turkic military slave faction (who were formerly recruited by the Samanid rulers in positions of governance) were fully in charge of the government.

"In 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the Zarafshan valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others.

"The system of the Samanid state was modelled after the Abbasid system, which in turn was modelled after the Sasanian system. The ruler of the state was the amir, and the provinces were governed by appointed governors or local vassal rulers. The administrative, political and economic affairs were administered by the divan, and the Samanid bureaucracy used Arabic in its diplomatic discourses. The economy was managed by the mustawfi, diplomatic correspondence and important state papers by the diwanal-rasa'il, and the royal guard and military affairs by the sahib al-shurta. The main responsibility of both governors and local rulers was to collect taxes and support the Samanid ruler with troops if needed. The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was initially given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the Muhtajids), but was later given to one of his most trusted slaves. The governor of Khorasan was normally the sipah-salar (commander-in-chief).Like in the Abbasid Caliphate, Turkic slaves could rise to high office in the Samanid state, which would sometimes give them enough power to nearly make the ruler their puppet."

"The Samanids revived Persian culture by patronizing Rudaki, Bal'ami and Daqiqi. The Samanids determinedly propagated Sunni Islam, and repressed Ismaili Shiism but were more tolerant of Twelver Shiism. Islamic architecture and Islamo-Persian culture was spread deep into the heartlands of Central Asia by the Samanids. Following the first complete translation of the Qur'an into Persian in the 9th century, populations under the Samanid empire began accepting Islam in significant numbers. The arabization of the Samanids was clearly minimal compared to the almost entirely arabized Tahirids. Despite Arabic literature and science flourishing in the Samanid Empire, its distance from Baghdad allowed the Samanids to be a crucial element in the renaissance of New Persian language and culture. This Persianate culture variant was the first to use a language besides Arabic in Islamic culture.Although the Zoroastrian population had previously been suppressed by the Abbasid Caliphate, according to Al-Masudi, the Samanid empire still had fire-temples that were still being venerated by the present Zoroastrian population. Despite the fact that the Samanids professed Sunni Islam, however, they were much more tolerant towards its Zoroastrian population than the previous empires.Through zealous missionary work as many as 30,000 tents of Turks came to profess Islam and later under the Ghaznavids more than 55,000 under the Hanafi school of thought. The mass conversion of the Turks to Islam eventually led to a growing influence of the Ghaznavids, who would later rule the region.Under Nuh II, a Hanafi work, which was being used to contest Ismailism, was translated into Persian.Agriculture and trading were the economic bases of the Samanid State. The Samanids heavily engaged in trade with Europe. Thousands of Samanid coins have been found in the Baltic and Scandinavia."

"During the 9th and 10th centuries, there was a large amount of growth in literature, mostly in poetry. It was during the Samanid period that Persian literature appeared in Transoxiana and was formally recognized. The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of Fars, the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were Rudaki (d. 941), Daqiqi (d. 977) and Ferdowsi (d. 1020).Although Persian was the most-favored language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family. For example, al-Tha'alibi wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-Dahr (""The Unique Pearl""). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.The acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of Panjrudak, which is today part of the Panjakent District in Tajikistan. Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the chang (an Iranian instrument similar to the harp). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Fewer than 2,000 lines of his poetry have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills—he perfected every basic verse form of medieval Persian poetry: mathnawi, qasida, ghazal and ruba'i."

"Another prominent poet was Shahid Balkhi, born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional elegy about him.Daqiqi, who was a native of Tus, began his career at the court of the Muhtajid ruler Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad in Chaghaniyan, and was later invited to the Samanid court. Under the Samanids, a special interest arose in ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the Shahnameh (""The Book of Kings""), a long epic poem based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between Gushtasp and Arjasp.However, the most prominent poet of that age was Ferdowsi, born in Tus in 940 to a dehqan family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud.

"Ferghana, Samarkand, and Bukhara were starting to be linguistically Persianized in originally Khwarazmian and Sogdian areas during Samanid rule. The Persian language spread and led to the extinction of Eastern Iranian languages like Bactrian and Khwarezmian with only a tiny amount of Sogdian-descended Yaghnobi speakers remaining among the now Persian-speaking Tajik population of Central Asia.  This was due to the fact that the Arab-Islamic army which invaded Central Asia at the time also included some Persians who later governed the region like the Samanids. Persian was rooted into Central Asia by the Samanids."	"refersTo(ExternalReference, ""ISBN 978-5-9524-3471-4"")

"In the 9th and 10th centuries, intellectual life in Transoxiana and Khorasan reached a high level. In the words of N.N. Negmatov, ""It was inevitable that the local Samanid dynasty, seeking support among its literate classes, should cultivate and promote local cultural traditions, literacy and literature.""The main Samanid towns – Bukhara, Samarkand, Balkh, Merv, Nishapur, Khujand, Bunjikath, Hulbuk, Termez and others, became the major cultural centres under the state. Scholars, poets, artists and other men of education from many Muslim countries assembled in the Samanid capital of Bukhara, where a rich soil was created for the prosper of creative thought, thus making it one of the most distinguished cultural centres of the Eastern world. An outstanding library known as Siwān al-Hikma (""Storehouse of Wisdom"") was put together in Bukhara, known for its various types of books."	"[(""Olga Medvedkova"", ""rdf:type"", ""Person""),

"Due to extensive excavations at Nishapur, Iran, in the mid-twentieth century, Samanid pottery is well-represented in Islamic art collections around the world. These ceramics are largely made from earthenware and feature either calligraphic inscriptions of Arabic proverbs, or colorful figural decorations. The Arabic proverbs often speak to the values of ""Adab"" culture—hospitality, generosity, and modesty."	"[""Florence, Lady Baker"", ""type"", ""Person""]

Some relationships, such as birth and death dates, are inferred based on the context and would use the ""contains"" relationship since specific ontology relationships for birth or death dates aren't provided. Additionally, relationships such as ""refersToPlaceOfOrigin"" and ""hasECVO"" are used according to the descriptive text and are inferred based on the concepts of origin and ethnicity (race, tribe, branch) that are provided in the ontology."	#NAME?

2. The number ""32"" can indicate a page number or reference number from an OriginRecord, which is an ExternalReference, but this is not explicit in the text.

Given that the text doesn't provide explicit information about document types, temporal extents, or other attributes like place of origin or events, we can only deduce a limited set of triples.

Considering the information given, we can formulate the following triple:

(Person: Zayd) isRelationshipFrom (PersonStatusRecord: died in infancy) (Person: Umm Kulthum)

However, since the provided ontology relations do not offer a direct way to express the 'son of' relationship or the 'died in infancy' status, we reach the limitations of the given ontology in extracting these specific triples.

Please note that certain triples such as a reference to temporal information (e.g., birth/death dates), document types, or geographic locations cannot be generated due to a lack of explicit information in the text and are not included in the ontology relations.

"Andrey (Andrei) Nikiforovich Voronikhin (Russian: Андрей Никифорович Воронихин; 28 October 1759, Novoe Usolye, Perm Oblast – 21 February 1814, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian architect and painter. As a representative of classicism he was also one of the founders of the monumental Russian Empire style. Born a serf of the Stroganov family, he is best known for his work on Kazan Cathedral in Saint Petersburg."	"Triple 1: (Muhammad, proposed, Zaynab bint Jahsh)

Triple 2: (Muhammad, wanted to arrange, the marriage)"	"In order to extract triples from the text, one needs to identify the entities, relationships, and attributes mentioned in the text that correspond to those in the ontology's concepts and relations. Here are the following triples that can be extracted from the test text given the limited context and ontology provided:

1. (Muhammad, isRelationshipTo, Zaynab bint Jahsh)
2. (Muhammad, isRelationshipFrom, Zayd)
3. (Zaynab bint Jahsh, hasStatusGeneratedEvent, MarriageProposal)

6. (MarriageProposal, hasParticipantRoleType, PotentialBride)
7. (MarriageProposal, hasParticipantRoleType, PotentialGroom)
8. (Quraysh, refersToPlaceOfOrigin, Zaynab bint Jahsh)

Please note that the text does not provide explicit temporal or spatial extents, nor specific document types, provenance activities, or external referents to construct more detailed triples. Also, since no ontology relations are directly about marriage proposals or social status, the triples related to these depend on interpretation and could be refined with a more detailed ontology including concepts such as MarriageProposal or SocialStatus."	None of the information in the context matches the ontology and hence no triples can be extracted.
"Andrey Voronikhin was born in the village of Novoa Usolye (now Perm Krai) to a family who were the serfs of count Alexander Sergeyevich Stroganov, a longtime President of the Imperial Academy of Arts. It is generally believed that he was fathered by Alexander Stroganov. Voronikhin trained in painting in the workshop of Ural icon painter Gabriel Yushkov. The talents of his youth attracted Stroganov's attention, and in 1777 the count sent Voronikhin to study in Moscow. Among his teachers were Vasili Ivanovich Bazhenov and Matvey Fyodorovich Kazakov. After 1779 Voronikhin worked in Saint Petersburg."

"The earliest architecture of Voronikhin includes finishing the interiors of Stroganov Palace (1793). The magnificent baroque forms, proposed by Rastrelli, were replaced by Voronikhin with a strict classical order, characterized by simplicity and refinement. Furthermore, he reconstructed the interiors of the Stroganov Dacha on the Black River (1795 - 1796), and also built estates in Gorodnya (1798)."	"Zaynab is-a Person

married is-a InterAgentRelationshipRecord"	"The test text ""Zaynab acquiesced and married Zayd."" suggests an ""InterAgentRelationship"" between two personal agents ""Zaynab"" and ""Zayd"". The ontology relation that corresponds to such a connection is ""InterAgentRelationshipRecord"". However, the exact nature of the relationship (e.g., marriage) is not explicitly defined within the list of ontology concepts and relations provided. Without specific ontology relations for ""married"", we cannot directly extract triples for marriage; instead, we would need to use general inter-agent relationship terms from the ontology.

Therefore, considering the given ontology and its limitations, and keeping in mind that the test text indicates a relationship without specifying its type, here are potential triples formatted according to the ontology relations, assuming ""InterAgentRelationshipRecord"" could be used in a broad sense:

```
InterAgentRelationshipRecord1 isRelationshipFrom Zaynab
InterAgentRelationshipRecord1 isRelationshipTo Zayd
InterAgentRelationshipRecord1 hasInterAgentRelationshipType marriage
```

Note: We have inferred that ""marriage"" could be a type under ""InterAgentRelationshipTypes""; however, this inference is not based on the provided ontology concepts or relations. It is important to highlight that without more explicit information in the given ontology about marriage-related relationships, the output for the given test text would be speculative at best. The output format assumes that ""InterAgentRelationshipRecord1"" is a newly created instance of an inter-agent relationship."	"Extraction Results:

"He commanded several vessels within the territory of the Alaskan coastline.Following U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward's Alaska purchase of the vast region in 1867, Healy patrolled the 20,000 miles (32,000 km) of Alaskan coastline for more than 20 years, earning great respect from the natives and seafarers alike. After commercial fishing had depleted the whale and seal populations, his assistance with the introduction of Siberian reindeer helped prevent starvation among the Alaskan Natives. The author Jack London was inspired by Healy's command of the renowned  USRC Bear. It had a thick wooden hull, and was powered by steam-and-sail for use as a proto-icebreaker; it was put into service as a cutter in 1884.Nicknamed ""Hell Roaring Mike"", Healy was the fifth of 10 children of the  Healy family of Georgia, known for their achievements in the North after being born into slavery. Their parents were an Irish-born planter and his African-American mixed-race slave, with whom he had a common-law marriage. His father arranged for the children to be formally educated at boarding schools in the North. Predominately European in ancestry, they identified as Irish Catholics."

"Healy was born into slavery near Macon, Georgia, in 1839, as the fifth of ten children of Michael Morris Healy, an Irish immigrant planter, and Mary Eliza Smith, his common-law wife, a mixed-race African-American slave.The senior Healy was born in 1795 in Roscommon, Ireland, and immigrated to the U.S. in 1818 as a young man. He eventually acquired 1,500 acres (6.1 km2) of land in Georgia near Macon. He eventually owned 49 slaves as workers for his plantation; among them was 16-year-old Mary Eliza Smith (or Clark), described as an octoroon or a mulatto, whom he took as his wife in 1829. Under the partus principle in slave law, the Healy children were legally slaves because their mother was enslaved. As such they were prohibited formal education in Georgia, and their father sent them north to be schooled, a common practice of wealthy white planters who had mixed-race children.Though not unusual, the Healys' common-law marriage violated laws against inter-racial marriage. Healy's wealth and ambition provided for his children's education. Most of the children, all but one surviving infancy, achieved noteworthy success as adults. In the North, the Healy siblings were educated as and identified as Irish Catholics. They were part of a growing ethnic group in the mid-19th century United States. During the late 20th century, their individual professional achievements were claimed as notable firsts for African Americans."	"Is-a(Place, EntityWithProvenance)

"The oldest son, James Augustine Healy, born in 1830, first went to a Quaker school in New York and New Jersey. His father transferred him at age 14 to preparatory classes for the College of Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. His three younger brothers soon joined him: Hugh, 12, Patrick Francis Healy, 10, and Alexander Sherwood Healy (known as Sherwood), 8. Michael, then only 6, was not enrolled at Holy Cross until 1849.All four of the older brothers graduated from Holy Cross. The three eldest entered the priesthood. After attending seminaries in Montreal and Paris, James was ordained a priest at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in 1854. In the 20th century he was claimed as the first African-American priest in the Catholic Church. In 1875, he became the second bishop of the Diocese of Portland, Maine, and is known as the first U.S. Catholic African-American bishop.Patrick Healy became a Jesuit and was the first African American to earn a PhD; he completed it at Saint-Sulpice Seminary in Paris. At the age of 39, in 1874, he assumed the presidency of Georgetown College, at the time the largest Catholic college in the U.S.Sherwood Healy was also ordained as a priest, and earned a PhD at Saint-Sulpice. An expert in canon law, he served as director of the seminary in Troy, New York. Later he became rector of the cathedral in Boston. Sherwood was musical and formed the Boston Choral Union, which helped raise funds for a new cathedral. He died at age 39.The three Healy sisters attended parochial schools in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, ultimately entering Catholic orders. Martha, the oldest, left her convent after several years and moved to Boston, where two brothers were living and working. She married an Irish immigrant and had a son with him. Josephine lived with her family in Boston before joining the Religious Hospitallers of Saint Joseph. Eliza joined the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal, where she was known as Sister Mary Magdalen. After teaching in Quebec and Ontario, in 1903 Eliza was appointed abbess or mother superior of the convent and school of Villa Barlow in St. Albans, Vermont. She has become recognized as the first African American to reach this position.In May 1850, the Healys' mother Mary Eliza died, followed four months later by her husband, Michael Morris Healy. leaving James as the head of the family. He was unable to convince young Michael to follow him into the priesthood. Unhappy and rebellious at Holy Cross, Michael was sent in 1854 to a French seminary. In 1855, he left that school for England, where he signed on as a cabin boy with the Jumna, an American East Indian clipper, eventually serving as an officer on merchant vessels."

"Healy returned to Alaskan waters aboard the newly built USRC Rush in 1875. In 1880, by request of the captain of Corwin, he was transferred to serve as executive officer, but the assignment did not last long. In August 1881 he assumed his first command on Rush. Renowned naturalist John Muir made one voyage with Healy as part of an ambitious government scientific program. Healy was serving as First Officer of USRC Thomas Corwin during the summer of 1881.By 1882 Healy was given command of Corwin and was already thoroughly familiar with the Bering Sea and Alaska. In this command, he enforced liquor laws, protected seal and whale populations under treaty; delivered supplies, mail and medicines to remote villages; returned deserters to merchant ships, collected weather data, rendered medical assistance, conducted search and rescue, enforced federal laws, and accomplished exploration work. In October 1882 he took part in the Angoon Bombardment, in which the village of Angoon, Alaska was destroyed following hostage taking by the Tlingit.He attained the rank of captain on March 3, 1883. At this point in his career, Healy had earned a reputation as a person thoroughly familiar with Alaskan waters and as a commander who expected the most from his vessel and crew. He was at the same time known to be a hard drinker, and most of his junior officers found him difficult. He was respected for his efforts to rescue vessels and crews in peril.

"He took command of Bear in 1887. His reputation with the whalers was so well established that when the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Seaman's Union requested a board of inquiry to consider charges of drunkenness and cruelty against him, the whaler skippers quickly got the drunkenness charges dismissed. The cruelty charges stemmed from an incident aboard the whaler Estrella in 1889: Healy had a seaman ""triced up"" to restore order. Healy defended his actions as an effort to quell a mutiny, and the charge was eventually dismissed.In July 1889, Healy paid a courtesy call to the skipper of USRC Rush, Captain Leonard G. Shepard, in an intoxicated state, a serious breach of naval etiquette. Shortly thereafter, Shepard became the Chief of the Revenue Cutter Bureau and he wrote Healy warning him that if he could not control his drinking, he could face loss of command. Healy replied stating that he ""pledge[d] to you by all I hold most sacred that while I live never to touch intoxicants of any kind or description....One thing I will hate and that is to give up my command of the Bear. I love the ship, tho [it is] hard work.""During the last two decades of the 19th century, Healy was essentially the federal government's law enforcement presence in the vast territory. In his twenty years of service between San Francisco and Point Barrow, he acted as judge, doctor, and policeman to Alaskan natives, merchant seamen and whaling crews. The Native Americans and Alaskan Natives throughout the vast regions of the north came to know and respect him and called his ship ""Healy's Fire Canoe."" During visits to Siberia, across the Bering Sea from the Alaskan coast, Healy observed that the Chukchi people had domesticated caribou (reindeer), and used them for food, travel, and clothing. He had noted the reduction in the seal and whale populations in Alaska from commercial fishing activities. To compensate for this and aid in transportation, working with Reverend Sheldon Jackson, a Presbyterian missionary and political leader in the territory, Healy helped introduce reindeer from Siberia to Alaska as a source of food, clothing and other necessities for the Native peoples. This work was noted in the New York Sun newspaper in 1894. Healy's compassion for the native population was expressed in many deeds and in his standing order: ""Never make a promise to a native you do not intend to keep to the letter."""

"He commanded several vessels within the territory of the Alaskan coastline.Following U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward's Alaska purchase of the vast region in 1867, Healy patrolled the 20,000 miles (32,000 km) of Alaskan coastline for more than 20 years, earning great respect from the natives and seafarers alike. After commercial fishing had depleted the whale and seal populations, his assistance with the introduction of Siberian reindeer helped prevent starvation among the Alaskan Natives. The author Jack London was inspired by Healy's command of the renowned  USRC Bear. It had a thick wooden hull, and was powered by steam-and-sail for use as a proto-icebreaker; it was put into service as a cutter in 1884.Nicknamed ""Hell Roaring Mike"", Healy was the fifth of 10 children of the  Healy family of Georgia, known for their achievements in the North after being born into slavery. Their parents were an Irish-born planter and his African-American mixed-race slave, with whom he had a common-law marriage. His father arranged for the children to be formally educated at boarding schools in the North. Predominately European in ancestry, they identified as Irish Catholics."	"EntityWithProvenance(At-Taraf)

"Healy was born into slavery near Macon, Georgia, in 1839, as the fifth of ten children of Michael Morris Healy, an Irish immigrant planter, and Mary Eliza Smith, his common-law wife, a mixed-race African-American slave.The senior Healy was born in 1795 in Roscommon, Ireland, and immigrated to the U.S. in 1818 as a young man. He eventually acquired 1,500 acres (6.1 km2) of land in Georgia near Macon. He eventually owned 49 slaves as workers for his plantation; among them was 16-year-old Mary Eliza Smith (or Clark), described as an octoroon or a mulatto, whom he took as his wife in 1829. Under the partus principle in slave law, the Healy children were legally slaves because their mother was enslaved. As such they were prohibited formal education in Georgia, and their father sent them north to be schooled, a common practice of wealthy white planters who had mixed-race children.Though not unusual, the Healys' common-law marriage violated laws against inter-racial marriage. Healy's wealth and ambition provided for his children's education. Most of the children, all but one surviving infancy, achieved noteworthy success as adults. In the North, the Healy siblings were educated as and identified as Irish Catholics. They were part of a growing ethnic group in the mid-19th century United States. During the late 20th century, their individual professional achievements were claimed as notable firsts for African Americans."	"""Hisma"" refersToPlaceOfOrigin ""Judham tribe""

"The oldest son, James Augustine Healy, born in 1830, first went to a Quaker school in New York and New Jersey. His father transferred him at age 14 to preparatory classes for the College of Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. His three younger brothers soon joined him: Hugh, 12, Patrick Francis Healy, 10, and Alexander Sherwood Healy (known as Sherwood), 8. Michael, then only 6, was not enrolled at Holy Cross until 1849.All four of the older brothers graduated from Holy Cross. The three eldest entered the priesthood. After attending seminaries in Montreal and Paris, James was ordained a priest at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in 1854. In the 20th century he was claimed as the first African-American priest in the Catholic Church. In 1875, he became the second bishop of the Diocese of Portland, Maine, and is known as the first U.S. Catholic African-American bishop.Patrick Healy became a Jesuit and was the first African American to earn a PhD; he completed it at Saint-Sulpice Seminary in Paris. At the age of 39, in 1874, he assumed the presidency of Georgetown College, at the time the largest Catholic college in the U.S.Sherwood Healy was also ordained as a priest, and earned a PhD at Saint-Sulpice. An expert in canon law, he served as director of the seminary in Troy, New York. Later he became rector of the cathedral in Boston. Sherwood was musical and formed the Boston Choral Union, which helped raise funds for a new cathedral. He died at age 39.The three Healy sisters attended parochial schools in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, ultimately entering Catholic orders. Martha, the oldest, left her convent after several years and moved to Boston, where two brothers were living and working. She married an Irish immigrant and had a son with him. Josephine lived with her family in Boston before joining the Religious Hospitallers of Saint Joseph. Eliza joined the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal, where she was known as Sister Mary Magdalen. After teaching in Quebec and Ontario, in 1903 Eliza was appointed abbess or mother superior of the convent and school of Villa Barlow in St. Albans, Vermont. She has become recognized as the first African American to reach this position.In May 1850, the Healys' mother Mary Eliza died, followed four months later by her husband, Michael Morris Healy. leaving James as the head of the family. He was unable to convince young Michael to follow him into the priesthood. Unhappy and rebellious at Holy Cross, Michael was sent in 1854 to a French seminary. In 1855, he left that school for England, where he signed on as a cabin boy with the Jumna, an American East Indian clipper, eventually serving as an officer on merchant vessels."

(InterAgentRelationshipRecord_1, isRelationshipFrom, Muhammad bin Hamid Al-Razi)
(InterAgentRelationshipRecord_1, isRelationshipTo, Ibn Ishaq)

(InterAgentRelationshipRecord_2, isRelationshipFrom, Ibn Ishaq)
(InterAgentRelationshipRecord_2, isRelationshipTo, Abdullah bin Abi Bakr)
```

Since the ontology provided does not seem to include a specific relationship such as ""mentor of"", ""parent of"", etc., a generic ""InterAgentRelationshipRecord"" is used. The ""_1"" and ""_2"" are added to distinguish between the two relationships inferred from the text. However, the actual ontology relationships like ""hasParticipantRoleType"", ""occursBefore"", etc., are not explicitly mentioned in the text and hence cannot be derived without further context or assumptions. Therefore, I have provided the minimum inferred relationships based on the text."	"Extraction Results:

"He took command of Bear in 1887. His reputation with the whalers was so well established that when the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Seaman's Union requested a board of inquiry to consider charges of drunkenness and cruelty against him, the whaler skippers quickly got the drunkenness charges dismissed. The cruelty charges stemmed from an incident aboard the whaler Estrella in 1889: Healy had a seaman ""triced up"" to restore order. Healy defended his actions as an effort to quell a mutiny, and the charge was eventually dismissed.In July 1889, Healy paid a courtesy call to the skipper of USRC Rush, Captain Leonard G. Shepard, in an intoxicated state, a serious breach of naval etiquette. Shortly thereafter, Shepard became the Chief of the Revenue Cutter Bureau and he wrote Healy warning him that if he could not control his drinking, he could face loss of command. Healy replied stating that he ""pledge[d] to you by all I hold most sacred that while I live never to touch intoxicants of any kind or description....One thing I will hate and that is to give up my command of the Bear. I love the ship, tho [it is] hard work.""During the last two decades of the 19th century, Healy was essentially the federal government's law enforcement presence in the vast territory. In his twenty years of service between San Francisco and Point Barrow, he acted as judge, doctor, and policeman to Alaskan natives, merchant seamen and whaling crews. The Native Americans and Alaskan Natives throughout the vast regions of the north came to know and respect him and called his ship ""Healy's Fire Canoe."" During visits to Siberia, across the Bering Sea from the Alaskan coast, Healy observed that the Chukchi people had domesticated caribou (reindeer), and used them for food, travel, and clothing. He had noted the reduction in the seal and whale populations in Alaska from commercial fishing activities. To compensate for this and aid in transportation, working with Reverend Sheldon Jackson, a Presbyterian missionary and political leader in the territory, Healy helped introduce reindeer from Siberia to Alaska as a source of food, clothing and other necessities for the Native peoples. This work was noted in the New York Sun newspaper in 1894. Healy's compassion for the native population was expressed in many deeds and in his standing order: ""Never make a promise to a native you do not intend to keep to the letter."""

"Over a century later, Healy's Coast Guard successors conduct missions reminiscent of his groundbreaking work: protecting the natural resources of the region, suppressing illegal trade, resupply of remote outposts, enforcement of the law, and search and rescue. Even in the early days of Arctic operations, science was an important part of the mission. Healy is now known as the first African-American to command a ship of the United States government. Commissioned in 1999, the research icebreaker USCGC Healy was named in his honor.To commemorate the entire family's achievements, the former site in Jones County, Georgia of the Healy plantation is called Healy Point.

"The Visuddhimagga is one of the texts to give explicit details about how spiritual masters were thought to actually manifest supernormal abilities. It states that abilities such as flying through the air, walking through solid obstructions, diving into the ground, walking on water and so forth are achieved through changing one element, such as earth, into another element, such as air. The individual must master kasina meditation before this is possible. Dipa Ma, who trained via the Visuddhimagga, was said to demonstrate these abilities."	"refersToPlaceOfOrigin(OriginRecord, Place)

With these elements, the following triples can be extracted from the text:

However, the text does not give specific dates, locations, or explicit relationships that are directly representable as triples with the listed relations in the ontology.

Laghimā: the ability to become weightless or lighter than air.	"Saqāliba refersToPlaceOfOrigin Dénia

Mujāhid al-ʿĀmirī established Taifa of Dénia
Taifa of Dénia hasTemporalExtent 1010–1227
Taifa of Dénia extendsTo island of Majorca"	"In the provided context, there is no explicit relationship or entity that directly matches the content of the test text in relation to the ontology provided. The ontology concepts and relations focus on elements like EntityWithProvenance, ProvenanceActivity, DocumentTypes, Event, etc., while the test text narrates a historical event with specific entities such as ""Saqāliba,"" ""taifas,"" ""Caliphate of Cordoba,"" and ""Taifa of Dénia."" 

However, in an attempt to possibly align with the concepts on hand, we can assume the historical narrative itself could be an ""EntityWithProvenance"" as a documented event, and ""Caliphate of Cordoba"" could perhaps be seen as an ""Event"" with a ""TemporalExtent"" that ends in 1031. ""Mujāhid al-ʿĀmirī"" could be seen as a ""Person"" who ""performedBy"" a ""ProvenanceActivity"" (the organization and rebellion) and may have ""attributedTo"" the establishment of the ""Taifa of Dénia."" The ""Taifa of Dénia"" could be interpreted as a ""Place"" with ""PlaceTypeCV"" of a principality. The event of the Taifa of Dénia's establishment occurs in a ""TimeSpan"" from 1010 to 1227 and falls within the larger historical context of the collapse of the Caliphate.

Hence, with this interpretation to best match the available ontology (but still largely imperfect), a potential output could be something like (though none of these relationships are explicitly provided in the ontology, and this is a very loose interpretation):

```
Event(EntityWithProvenance) : Caliphate of Cordoba
endsAt(TemporalExtent, xsd:date) : 1031

Person(Agent) : Mujāhid al-ʿĀmirī
performedBy(ProvenanceActivity, Agent) : Mujāhid al-ʿĀmirī

Place(EntityWithProvenance) : Taifa of Dénia
startsAt(TemporalExtent,xsd:date) : 1010
endsAt(TemporalExtent,xsd:date) : 1227
```

Please note that this test output is speculative and provided to demonstrate the possibility of matching the ontology with a text. To generate actual triples according to the given ontology, one would need to be provided with relations and entities that are clearly reflected both in the ontology and in the data conveyed by the text."

""Abū Bakr ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Manṣūr"" is an individual (Person) mentioned along with temporal information (TemporalExtent) related to his brother (indicating an InterAgentRelationshipRecord), specified as ""prec.: 1075–1085"".

The triples according to the ontology relations would be as follows:

(TemporalExtent, TimeSpan, ""1075–1085"")

However, in the desired output format, these triples would be presented without the explicit ontology labels. Given that the ontology states ""Is-a(Person, Agent)"", ""Is-a(InterAgentRelationshipRecord, AgentRecord)"", and ""Is-a(TimeSpan, TemporalExtent)"", we can infer and adjust these triples.

The text discusses historical figures, literary works, and events in a general way without including standard identifiers or structured data that could be directly converted into triples using the given ontology.

However, we can infer some potential pieces of knowledge that might be placed within the ontology if further context or identifiers were available. For instance:

1. There could be an `Agent` representing the author of the texts being discussed. 
2. The `Sententiae` could be considered an `EntityWithProvenance`, and there could be a `hasOriginalSourceType` relating it to ancient literary `DocumentTypes`.
3. Aulus Gellius, being referenced as knowing of the `Sententiae`, could potentially be modeled as an `Agent` who `performedBy` a `ProvenanceActivity` related to the `Sententiae`.
4. The `TemporalExtent` of when the Sententiae was known could potentially be modeled with `contains` pointing to the `2nd century AD`.
5. The `OriginRecord` of the `Sententiae` could have references to `Place`, like Rome or classical locations.

Based on these inferences, here are hypothetical triples that could be derived from the text with additional context and identifiers:

1. `[Agent: ""Aulus Gellius""] performedBy [ProvenanceActivity: ""knowledge_of_Sententiae""]`
2. `[EntityWithProvenance: ""Sententiae""] hasOriginalSourceType [DocumentTypes: ""ancient_literary_texts""]`
3. `[TemporalExtent: ""when_Sententiae_was_known""] contains [xsd:date: ""2nd century AD""]`
4. `[OriginRecord:""Sententiae_origin""] refersToPlaceOfOrigin [Place: ""classical_location_identifier""]`

Please note that the use of quotes is for illustrative purposes and actual representation would not include them. Also, these hypothetical triples would require additional context to be seen as valid within the provided ontology structure. Since the actual text provided does not include specific entity identifiers or structured mentioning of events that can be mapped to the ontology, a literal output of triples from the provided text is not feasible."
